# Storage collision

## Intro

In the bustling city of Technopolis, a renowned company named "SecureStore Inc." managed storage solutions for a wide range of clients. They had recently shifted their warehouse access management system to a blockchain-based solution to improve security and transparency. The company operated two main warehouses, ElectroHub and AgroCenter, each with its own set of access permissions.With different permissions different access levels of the warehouses can be accesed that are managed by the SecureStore contract, allowing for finer-grained control over who can access what in the system. The warehouse access control system was designed to provide clients with the ability to securely access their storage units and monitor the flow of goods.

For years, the company had been accumulating a significant amount of Ether. However, they failed to implement adequate security measures to protect their digital assets.

One day, a cybercriminal known as CyberPhantom discovered a vulnerability in the smart contract. He realized that a specific function could allow them to exploit the contract and take all the funds the company received from payments from their clients.

The breach caused panic among clients, resulting in a loss of trust in SecureStore's services. The company suffered a massive financial loss, and their reputation was irreparably damaged. The incident served as a stark reminder of the importance of implementing proper security measures and protocols when it comes to blockchain-based systems.

Can you do the same by tampering with the owner's address?
